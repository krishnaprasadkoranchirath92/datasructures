Method - Functions written inside class.
Arguments/actual parameters - Parameters at calling side
Parameters/formal parameters - Parameters in the called function
Functions get executed in call stack
Call By value : When parameters are passed to a function, a copy of the original parameters are passed. 
The changes made by the called function doesn't reflect on the calling function. Java has call by value.
Call by reference : Direct passing of original variables (not copies)
