Fibonacci problem
//For recursion TC = O(2^n) -tree
//For DP TC = O(n)- skewed tree

DP is optimized recursion
How to identify DP?
a. Optimal problem
b. Some choices are given (multiple branches in recursion tree)
c. Overlapping sub problems and optimal substructure

Ways of DP
1. Memoization - Top down - Uses memory - Used in recursion
2. Tablulation  - Bottom up - Used in iteration
